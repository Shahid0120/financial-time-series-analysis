This is a compilation of the course UNSW Financial Mathematics MNATH3311. This course focuses on numerical analysis, the structure of matrix effects on numerical analysis, interpolation methods, solving linear systems, and applications to financial markets, but lacks any time series analysis, including ARIMA, filtering, unit root tests, MNN for time series, LightGBM for time series, or exploratory analysis.

Thus, I have independently been going through "Time Series Analysis and Its Applications" by Robert Shumway and David Stoffer, and "Time Series Analysis with Python" by FilippoMB from Arctic University of Norway. Of course, this is where this repository has started, and I'm sure there will be more resources used in the future!
